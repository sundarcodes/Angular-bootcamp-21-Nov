Problem Statement :

Develop a program to calculate the total and individual player scores in a cricket match. Input would be an array with the index representing the ball number and the value representing the runs scored of that ball.

Assumptions/Tips:
1.	No Extras bowled
2.	Batsman has to be rotated after ever over
3.	Bowler can bowl any number of overs
4.	Assume Batsman 1 is on strike for the first ball.


Sample Input : [1,2,0,0,4,1,6,2,1,3];

Output:
Total Score: 20
Batsman 1 Score : 4 (1 + 3)
Batsman 2 Score : 16 (2 + 4 + 1 + 6 + 2 + 1)

Future Extensions:

1.	Print also the overs bowled by a bowler and runs given
2.	Also, include extras n wickets into the scoring.


Algo

1. Go through the array
2. Accumulate the total score
3. Add runs to the striker
4. Check if run scored is odd or even
5. If odd, rotate strike.
6. Check if balls mod 6, rotate strike
